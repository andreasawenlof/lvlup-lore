### Lighthouse Testing

The following pages were tested with Lighthouse for performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO:

| Page             | Performance | Accessibility | Best Practices | SEO  |
|-------------------|-------------|----------------|----------------|------|
| Homepage          | 72%         | 85%            | 80%            | 65%  |
| Post Detail Page  | 78%         | 88%            | 82%            | 70%  |
| Contact Page      | 75%         | 90%            | 85%            | 68%  |

#### Observations
1. **Performance**: Scores were impacted by unoptimized images and lack of caching.
2. **Accessibility**: Minor contrast issues were identified and will be addressed in future iterations.
3. **Best Practices**: Warnings were caused by third-party scripts.
4. **SEO**: Missing structured data and meta descriptions lowered the SEO scores.

### W3C Validation

W3C validation was performed on the following pages:
- Homepage
- Post Detail Page
- Contact Us Page

#### Validation Results
The validation flagged similar non-critical issues across all pages:

| Issue                          | Cause                                                                                  | Impact                     |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Trailing slashes on void tags  | Tags like `<meta>` and `<link>` include a trailing slash for XHTML compatibility.       | No impact on functionality. |
| Missing `<p>` tags in scope    | Caused by dynamic Django template logic producing unmatched `</p>` tags in rare cases. | Does not affect rendering or usability. |

#### Observations
- These issues are consistent across the site due to shared templates (e.g., `base.html`) and reusable components.
- All other aspects of the HTML passed validation without errors.

#### Planned Fixes
1. **Trailing Slashes**: Will be removed in future updates to comply strictly with HTML5 standards.
2. **Unmatched Tags**: Template logic will be reviewed and refined to ensure all HTML tags are properly paired.

---

While this issue is acknowledged, it is considered **non-critical** for this projectâ€™s current state and submission timeline. Future updates will address the error to ensure full compliance with W3C standards.


Planned improvements include:
- Implementing lazy loading for images.
- Adding structured data for better SEO.
- Enhancing color contrast and adding ARIA labels where needed.


## Knows Bugs
The only thing (not sure i would call it a bug) is that success message doesn't work on delete because of the modal and I can't seem to be able to figure it out. 

---

## Summary
- All core features have been tested and work as expected.
- Known bugs are documented for future fixes.
- The site is responsive across all tested devices and browsers.
